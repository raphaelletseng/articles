<hr> 

Like clockwork, the city begins to wake. The sun has not yet reached the tops of the buildings but already
below people are rushing from one place to another. The bronze wheels and cogs of the bustling
metropolis that is Sydney begin to turn, like every morning of every week.

Underground, the subways glide smoothly; transporting batches of businessmen, students and workers to
their destinations. The subway has always been any Australian commuter’s first choice of transport and
will undoubtedly continue to be; its efficiency is unparalleled. The sheer number of people who travel on
these lines is impressive, and yet the efficacy with which they manage to avoid walking into each other is
even more so. On this particular morning, the clockwork motions of the commuters, usually executed with
such skill and precision seem cold and pragmatic. Warily, people bustle past each other, eyes cast down,
chins tucked into chests and hands deep in pockets, avoiding each other like the plague. Despite the
warm weather, the air is frigid.

One woman stands out in the crowd; a spark of colour amidst the dark heads. Her bright hijab
immediately identifies her as different, and as she steps onto a subway car, the atmosphere palpably
changes. Backs turn, earphones go in, seats become taken. Conscious of the effect of her arrival, the
woman moves into a corner, making herself smaller in the narrow space. Guarded, wary, calculating
stares observe her as the train trembles along the tracks. The air feels suffocating and each person holds
their breath - watching her. She can feel them looking. Having worn a hijab for so long, she is
accustomed to the odd glance and curious gaze living in a country, where her appearance is not the
norm. Usually, she embraces her cultural differences, wears her headscarf with pride and rejoices in its
meaning and message. But not today, when she know she is the cause of the sombre mist shrouding the
world.

Contrary to popular belief, she has never felt forced into covering her head. If anything, the headscarf has
always given her comfort, safe and secure in the knowledge that she is closer to her God with it. It’s an
ever present reminder of the behaviours and values expected of her; to be kind and forgiving to everyone.
Wearing the vibrant coloured cloth styled with expert hands usually makes her feel confident; it takes a
certain amount of courage and strength to define yourself within society and the community in such a
visual fashion.

But today, when every gaze is fixated upon the shimmering colour that falls loosely across her shoulders,
that confidence and courage has vanished. Society has a way of making the strongest people crumple
under it’s unwavering eye, and maybe it’s the way that even the smallest of children are watching her with
accusatory stares or perhaps simply the stifling, humid heat on this particular summer morning, but the
woman is suddenly hit with the most overwhelming urge to just take it off. Just to stop this irrational
islamophobia, for one second and relieve the pressure and fear so tangible in the air.

With shaking hands she reaches up to her headscarf, a symbol of her culture and beliefs. If anyone
stopped to properly look, they would see the subtle threads and colours, painstakingly sewn into blazing
motifs across the fabric, making it shimmer and shine with life. Nimble fingers untuck folds of cloth and
with downcast eyes, the woman unwraps her heritage. Spools of fabric flow through her fingers like liquid 
silk until her hair is left bare to the world. Without a word, she folds it carefully, holding the material
between her hands for a moment. And yet still, like vultures, the people stare.

“Wait.”

The rumble of the tracks go quiet and a man stands from where he’d previously been seated.

“Put it back on. I’ll ride with you.”

The hundred pairs of eyes widen as they turn to look at this newcomer. There’s nothing particularly
extraordinary about him and yet when he moves to stand next to the woman, her eyes glow with stunned
appreciation. Without a word, the man slips one earphone back in, as though his actions are entirely
normal. As though nothing risky or controversial has just occurred. The vultures continue to stare and the
woman remains silent.

Then, with soft hands, she puts the hijab back on.

One word is whispered between her lips: a simple thank you, and then, readjusting her headscarf, she
turns to get off at the stop. As the train doors open she steps back out into the ordered chaos of the
world, her back just a little straighter, head held a little higher.
