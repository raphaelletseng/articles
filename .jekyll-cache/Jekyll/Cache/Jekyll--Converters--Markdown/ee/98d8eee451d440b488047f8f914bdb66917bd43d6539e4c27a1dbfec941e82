Hi! Iâ€™m Raph, a final year Mathematics and Computer Science major at McGill University, in Montreal, Canada.
I am interested in exploring artificial intelligence in areas where it can affect social and environmental good, as well as the ethics of AI. Currently, I am part of the <a href="http://mcgillai.com">McGill Artificial Intelligence Society</a>, where I have met a lovely community of humans who share and broaden my interests! I also volunteer in my spare time as a web developer with <a href="https://www.earthhero.org">Earth Hero</a>, another awesome group of activists passionate about effectively responding to the climate emergency.</p>

<p>I drink gallons of tea, thrive in warm weather, and have a soft spot for cats. I am currently fostering a large-pawed, black shadow from the <a href="https://www.spca.com/en/">SPCA</a> named Kido.</p>

<p>Send me a message if youâ€™re interested in working together (Or if you have cute cat photos to share)!</p>
