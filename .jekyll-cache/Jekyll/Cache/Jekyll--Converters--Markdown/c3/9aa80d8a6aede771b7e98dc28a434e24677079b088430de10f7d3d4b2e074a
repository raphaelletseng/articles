I"h<p>Recently, my boss asked me if I’d be able to automate and expedite the analysis of a set of data
so that my colleagues would be able to avoid manually copying and pasting numbers into
columns on excel. For me this proposed a few new challenges I had not yet encountered:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Writing a working piece of code in python, a language I’d used sparingly and never
for any kind of big project up until now.</li>
  <li>Figuring out how to generate graphs using matplotlib</li>
  <li>Figuring out how to output everything as a word document containing images that depended on the raw
input data.</li>
</ol>
