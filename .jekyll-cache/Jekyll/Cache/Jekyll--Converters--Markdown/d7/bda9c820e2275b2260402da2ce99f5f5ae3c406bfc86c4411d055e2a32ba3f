I"¸<p>Iâ€™ve been keeping notebooks as journals / agendas / sketchbooks etc. for over six years now. They act as places where I can make endless lists, doodle, write, and brainstorm.
Iâ€™m coming towards the end of the one Iâ€™ve had since October 2019, and I wanted to compile all the little drawings Iâ€™ve haphazardly done in the margins and over notes. Often,
Iâ€™ll study artists and illustrators that I really enjoy, so I canâ€™t claim anything here for my own. Iâ€™ll also occasionally draw from pinterest images or just from my imagination.</p>

<p>Some artists / illustrators I very much enjoy and owe credit to:</p>
