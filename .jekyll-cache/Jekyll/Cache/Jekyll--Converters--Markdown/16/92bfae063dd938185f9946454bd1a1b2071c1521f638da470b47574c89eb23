<p>Hi! I’m Raph, a final year Mathematics and Computer Science major at McGill University, in Montreal, Canada.
I am interested in:</p>
<ul>
  <li>exploring artificial intelligence in areas where it can affect positive social and environmental change</li>
  <li>the ethics of AI  <br /></li>
</ul>

<p>I work under <strong><a href="http://jguo-web.com/">Prof. Jin Guo</a></strong> in the <a href="http://jguo-web.com/lab.html">Knowledge and Software (KAST) lab</a>, researching the effects of privacy on fairness in Machine Learning models.</p>

<p>I also volunteer in the Oceanic and Atmospheric Sciences Department, applying ML techniques to investigate the circulation of the western North Atlantic shelf by tracking virtual particles in a climate model.</p>

<p>Currently, I am part of the <strong><a href="http://mcgillai.com">McGill Artificial Intelligence Society</a></strong>, where I have met a lovely community of humans who share and broaden my interests! I also volunteer in my spare time as a web developer with <strong><a href="https://www.earthhero.org">Earth Hero</a></strong>, another awesome group of activists passionate about effectively responding to the climate emergency.</p>

<p>I drink gallons of tea, thrive in warm weather, and have a soft spot for cats. I am currently fostering a large-pawed, black shadow from the <a href="https://www.spca.com/en/">SPCA</a> named Kido.</p>

<p>Send me a <strong><a href="mailto:raphaelletseng@gmail.com">message</a></strong> if you’re interested in working together (Or if you have cute cat photos to share)!</p>
