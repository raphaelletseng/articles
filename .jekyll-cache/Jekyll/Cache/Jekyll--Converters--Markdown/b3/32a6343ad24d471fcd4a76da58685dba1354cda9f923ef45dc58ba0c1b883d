I"<p>Sentiment Analysis is a subset of Natural Language Processing (NLP), a branch of AI that
is concerned with understanding, modelling and engineering natural language. Sentiment
analysis refers to using NLP to classify and study texts to determine whether data is
positive or negative (or neutral).
In this particular, introductory example, I am just going to be training classifiers to
identify positive and negative sentiments. The goal is to play around with different
kinds of classifiers, in order to try and determine which ML model works best for
sentence-level sentiment classification.
I will be using scikit-learn and nltk.</p>
