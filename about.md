Hi! I'm Raph, a final year Mathematics and Computer Science major at McGill University, in Montreal, Canada.
I am interested in exploring artificial intelligence in areas where it can affect social and environmental good, as well as the ethics of AI. Currently, I am part of the [McGill Artificial Intelligence Society](http://mcgillai.com), where I have met a lovely community of humans who share and broaden my interests!

I drink gallons of tea, thrive in warm weather, and have a soft spot for cats. I am currently fostering a cuddly furball from the [SPCA](https://www.spca.com/en/) named Ouzzo.

Send me a message if you're interested in working together (Or if you have cute cat photos to share)!
